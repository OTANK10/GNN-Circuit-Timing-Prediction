# GNN-Circuit-Timing-Prediction
This is an attempt to utilize Graphical Neural Networks to predict timing closures in gate level circuits as VLSI nodes are naturally graph structures.

# What are GNNs?  
GNNs are neural networks designed to work with graph-structured data. Unlike traditional neural networks that work with fixed-size inputs (like images or sequences), GNNs can handle irregular graph structures where nodes have varying numbers of connections.


Key concepts:

Nodes: Individual elements (in VLSI: gates, cells, pins)  
Edges: Connections between elements (wires, nets)  
Node features: Properties like gate type, timing, power  
Edge features: Wire length, resistance, capacitance  

# Technical Skills Showcased  

Graph Neural Networks: Understanding of modern AI architectures  
VLSI Domain Knowledge: Gate delays, fanout, timing analysis  
PyTorch & PyTorch Geometric: Industry-standard ML frameworks  
End-to-end ML Pipeline: Data generation, training, evaluation, visualization
